# automated_email_sending

<hr>

## purpose of code
This project automatically sends a randomly selected message to a target device. The inspiration for the code was to help my friend achieve the rank of eagle scout by sending him automatic reminders everyday until he turned 18.

The code is based on the google apps script API

For reference on setting up automatic scripts, see [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview)
